# RLereWolf

## Setup
The development of RLereWolf is done in Visual Studio 2019 as a "PyProject" using Python 3.9. In order to setup RLereWolf for development "out of the box" you need to

1. Install Python 3.9
2. Install Visual Studio 2019 with Python support (You can use your preferred editor/IDE, just be aware setting it up might be a bit more awkward)
3. Install the requirements - "pip3.9 install -r requirements.txt"
4. Select any of the pre-made boot configurations (Client, Server, Client + Server etc.) or add your own in the [project startup settings](https://github.com/GeorgeVelikov/RLereWolf/blob/main/Werewolf.sln.startup.json), as seen in:
